2. mvn eclipse:eclipse - This will run the resource ready phase and download all the dependencies to maven repo, and create .classpath, .project etc.
3. mvn clean install -Dmaven.compiler.source=1.7 -Dmaven.compiler.target=1.7 -DskipTests - (-Dmaven.compiler.source=1.7) this is to change the jre version to 1.7,(-DskipTests) this is to skip the junit tests.
