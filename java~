#JAVA 

#JVM

->A java code is writte in a .java file 
->Javac compliler would compile this .java file and produce a .class file
->the .class file is nothing but the bytecode
->this bytecode is like the machine code for the jvm
->Then jvm would convert this bytecode to the machine code specific to the machine.
->This is the reason the bytecodes are portable.

#JAVA is a platform

A platform is an environment where the program runs.It can be hardware or a sofware for ex(windows,linux etc).JAVA is a software platform which maiky consist of:

*JVM
*JAVA API

JAVA API is a large library(ready made code).So the JVM would take care of producing the machine code to the machine.

#JAVA CONCEPTS

->Object:It is a bundle consisting of state(fields) and behavior(method).
->Class:It is a blue print for which the objects are created.
->Inheritence:subclass extending the common functionality of the parent class.
->Interphase:It is contract signed by a class to implement the functions defined in a interface.
->polymorphism:In different forms(function overloading).
->Abstract:If there is repetition of a functionality in the child classes then define parent as abstract and keep the repitition in parent.
Abstract class can't be instantiated.
->Genrics:Passing of parameters as type<E> to classes,methods. 
->Annotation:It is like a metadata to the compiler(ex:@test)
->Exception:It is an event which would cause the disruption of the normal flow.It depends how u want to handle that event.
->Stream:It is like a pipe with two ends and at one end u the put the data and on the other end it starts to flush to the file.
Internally it would store some data in buffer so to make sure everything goes out u say flush then write.
It is always good to close the stream, otherwise resource leak would happen.When we open a stream then os would allot a file handle(file handles are fixed).This file handler will be released when a stream is closed.
->Data streams are used to write the data of specific data type say int,double int ect.
->Collection - it is an object which stores similar elements in to a single unit.
*Interphase:contract
*Implementation:hash,tree,linked list
*Algo:sorted etc

Set:Elements can't be repeated.(Implementation: Hashset,Treeset,Linkedlistset)
List:Elements can be accessed through the index.Elements can be repeated(Implementation:Arraylist,Linked list).
Queue
Dequeue
Map:(key,value):(Implementation:)
